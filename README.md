# PHPScraper

This is a PHP Scraper for news.tj.

You can use this by installing PHP and then setting up a local server:

"sudo pacman -S php" or however you can install it.

And then run:
"php -S localhost:8080", you might need to run it with sudo depending on your system permissions.

After running the above lines, go to "localhost:8080" or "localhost:8080/index.php" to run the script.

After running the script, you should have the files included in the GitHub repo (i.e, general_tag_matches.txt, etc).
